          <p>Instead of supporting our mission to organize more awesome dance events, we would like to welcome you to donate to help people in need. You can pay for your festival tickets as a donation to one of the following humanitarian aid organizations:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://donate.unrwa.org/int/en/general">UNRWA</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.redcross.fi/donate/">Red Cross</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://laakaritilmanrajoja.fi/en/donate/">Doctors Without Borders</a></li>
          </ul>

          <h6 class="header-primary mt-4">How?</h6>

          <p>When buying your ticket, select <b>Donate to Humanitarian Aid</b> as the payment option. Then go to one of the links above and make a one-time donation equal to the final ticket amount. We will send you an email requesting proof of donation in order to confirm your ticket.</p>
